* the defualt compiler generated a default :
    * constructor
    * destructor
    * copy constructor
=============Copy assignement operator=================
* c++ gives us a free : 
    * copy constructor
    * copy assignement constructor, but it does a shallow copy.
  ===> anytime we use new malloc any memory allocation function
        where we have a pointer  we want to write your own 
        copy constructor
* copy assignement operator : 
    is called for when an object has been constructed

=====================fixed point==============
* Fixed-point representation is a way of encoding real numbers 
  within a computer using a fixed number of digits (bits) for the 
  integer and fractional parts. In this representation, 
  the position of the decimal (or binary) point is fixed, 
  meaning that the number of digits allocated for the integer 
  and fractional parts is predetermined.


=====================the rule of three==========
* is a best practise a guideline that tries to help write 
  classes that manage external resources such as 
  dynamically allocated memory safely.
* the rule says basically if you include any one of those
  methods: 1 - destructor
           2 - copy constructor
           3 - copy assignement constructor
 in your class then you should probably include all three of them
